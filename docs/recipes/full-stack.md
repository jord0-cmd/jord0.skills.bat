# The Full Stack

**Skills used:** ALL OF THEM

The complete workflow. Every skill in its place. From project kickoff to daily work to persistent knowledge.

---

## Day 0: Project Setup

### Load your standards

```
/strict
```

Every session starts here. Non-negotiable. The 11 rules are loaded and Claude applies them to everything.

### Onboard the codebase

```
/forge
```

FORGE reads the entire project, generates a `CLAUDE.md` with architecture, patterns, conventions. Claude now understands your codebase at a structural level.

### Research unknowns

```
/recall [your tech stack]          # Check existing knowledge first
/recon [topic you need to learn]   # Deep research if needed
```

Build your knowledge base from day one. Every research session compounds.

---

## Day 1+: The Daily Flow

### Start of session

```
/portal open yesterday
```

Context restored. You know where you were, what you decided, what's next.

### Making decisions

For big decisions:

```
/conclave [the question]     # Get 9 perspectives
/mirror [the recommendation] # Stress-test it
/echo create [decision-name] # Record it
```

For smaller decisions:

```
/mirror [the approach]       # Quick stress-test
/echo create [decision-name] # Record it
```

### When you're stuck

```
/spark [the problem]         # Divergent thinking — find the non-obvious
```

### When you need research

```
/recall [topic]              # Check knowledge base first
/recon [topic]               # Full research if needed
```

### Long-running tasks

```
/notify "Build Complete" "Ready for review" --choices "Review Now" "Later"
```

Claude taps you on the shoulder when it's done.

### End of session

```
/echo create [any-decisions-made]  # Capture reasoning
/portal create eod                 # Save everything
```

## The Flywheel

Here's what happens over time:

1. **RECON** fills the knowledge base
2. **RECALL** makes lookups instant
3. **ECHO** records decisions with reasoning
4. **PORTAL** preserves session context
5. **FORGE** documents each project

Every session adds to the system. Every future session benefits from everything that came before. Knowledge accumulates. Decisions are documented. Context persists.

You don't just get better at using Claude. Claude gets better at helping *you*.

---

## Minimum Viable Workflow

Not ready for the full stack? Start with three:

1. **STRICT** — load at session start
2. **PORTAL** — save at session end
3. **ECHO** — record big decisions

Add the rest as the habits form. The foundation matters most.

*This is the way.*
