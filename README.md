  13 production skills for Claude Code


```

# jord0.skills

**13 production-grade skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview).** Copy a folder, get a superpower.

By [jord0.cmd](https://github.com/jord0-cmd)

---

## 📖 Documentation

### **[jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills](https://jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills/)**

The full docs site has everything you need to get the most out of these skills:

- **[Getting Started](https://jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills/getting-started/install/)** — Install guide, your first skill walkthrough, how skills work under the hood
- **[Skill Guides](https://jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills/skills/)** — Deep dive on every skill with usage examples, advanced tricks, and tips
- **[Recipes](https://jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills/recipes/)** — Multi-skill workflows: session preservation, cross-machine portals, decision audit trails, the full-stack daily ritual
- **[Architecture](https://jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills/architecture/)** — How the skill system works, data flow diagrams, design principles for building your own

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jord0-cmd/jord0.skills.git
cp -r jord0.skills/skills/* ~/.claude/skills/
```

All 13 skills are installed. No build step, no configuration. Start a Claude Code session and use them immediately.

> **Note:** Most skills are zero-dependency. OPTIC requires Python + a Gemini API key, LOCUS requires a React environment, and NOTIFY requires platform-specific notification tools. Everything else works out of the box.

See the [full install guide](https://jord0-cmd.github.io/jord0.skills/getting-started/install/) for alternative install methods including the plugin marketplace.

## NOTIFY Prerequisites

NOTIFY is the only skill with external dependencies. It sends real desktop notifications from your Claude Code session.

| Platform | Requirement | Install |
|----------|------------|---------|
| **WSL** | BurntToast PowerShell module | `Install-Module -Name BurntToast -Force` (in PowerShell) |

All other skills are zero-dependency.

## How Skills Work

Claude Code skills are markdown files that extend Claude's capabilities. When you invoke a skill (e.g., `/portal create my-project`), Claude reads the skill's `SKILL.md` and follows its instructions.

Each skill in this repo is a self-contained folder:

```
skills/
  PORTAL/
    SKILL.md          # The skill definition
  NOTIFY/
    SKILL.md          # The skill definition
    scripts/          # Supporting scripts (if any)
      toast.py
      notify.sh
```

Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/` and are automatically available in all Claude Code sessions.

---

## Compatibility

- **Claude Code** v1.0+
- **Models**: Works with all Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku). Best results with Opus/Sonnet.
- **Platforms**: Linux, macOS, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

---

## Philosophy

These skills were extracted from a production AI development environment. They've been used daily for months, refined through real work, and stress-tested on real projects.

The design principles:

1. **Self-contained** — each skill works by copying one folder
2. **No lock-in** — standard markdown, standard JSON, no proprietary formats
3. **Prerequisites are documented** — if a skill needs something, it tells you
4. **Quality over quantity** — 13 skills that work perfectly > 100 that kinda work
